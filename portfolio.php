		<h4>Check out my designs!</h4>
		
		<p>These sites were built from the ground up. Along with coding, I also dabble in knitting, agility training and 
		accumulating Miniature Schnauzers.</p>
		
		<p>I sell my sweater designs as pdf downloads and have created award-winning 
		knit pieces for the past two years.</p>
